# Click to Cancel Assistant

This project is a lightweight React application built with Vite that simulates a cancellation assistant conversation. It runs fully in the browser and streams responses generated with the [`@xenova/transformers`](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js) implementation of DistilGPT-2.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static site will be emitted to the `dist` directory, ready to be deployed to services such as Vercel.
